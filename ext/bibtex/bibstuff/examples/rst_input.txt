Introduction
============

This introction will simply demonstrate some citations which can be
found in the ``example.bib`` database.  To expand these citations or
produce a bibliography list, use ``bib4txt.py``.  The output should
look like ``testout.txt``.

We have noticed that some people running this example
encounter a simpleparse error with python 2.5.
For example, Ubuntu users should download the SourceForge
``simpleparse`` code rather than the Ubuntu packages.
Uninstall the ``python-simpleparse`` and ``python-simpleparse-mxtexttools`` packages,
download the SourceForge simpleparse, and do ``python setup.py install``.

Now for some citations.  Originally reST only supported citation
reference names that were valid HTML and XML names [isaac.schwilk-2010]_.
Recently reST added support for colons and plus signs, since these
are common in BibTeX databases [schwilk+isaac:2010]_.
(However, we recommend that you avoid these characters if you are
creating a new database.)  Naturally ``bib4txt.py`` will recognize
all valid reST citation references.  However, it will also recognize
for multiple comma-separated cites
[isaac.schwilk-2010, schwilk+isaac:2010, man-2010]_.

That should be enough for a test.

Use an `include directive`_ if you want to include the ``testout.txt`` bibliography.
